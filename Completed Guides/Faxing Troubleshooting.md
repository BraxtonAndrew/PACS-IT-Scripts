#### Step 1: Verify Cable Connections

1. Check Both Ends:  
    Ensure the fax cable is securely plugged in at both ends:
    
    - The fax machine or printer.
    - The MPOE (Minimum Point of Entry) or wall jack.
2. Correct Port on Fax Machine:
    
    - Confirm the cable is connected to the Line/Phone port on the fax machine.
    - DO NOT connect the cable to the Ext port.
        - The Ext port is for extensions and cannot receive faxes.
3. Physical Cable Movement:
    
    - If the user has moved the fax machine to a different office, they must also move the physical cable to the new location.

#### Step 2: Confirm Printer/Fax Machine Settings

1. Fax Number Setup:  
    Ensure the correct fax number is programmed into the machine.
    
2. Send and Receive Configuration:  
    Verify that the fax machine is configured to both send and receive faxes.

#### Step 3: Test the Fax Connection

1. Send a Test Fax:
    
    - Use the machine to send a test fax to a known working fax number (e.g., another internal machine or a trusted external number).
    - Ensure the fax goes through successfully.
2. Test with a Different Recipient:
    
    - If the issue occurs with only one fax number, the problem may lie with that recipient’s setup.
3. Call the Fax Number:
    
    - Dial the fax number directly using a phone to check:
        - If the line is open and operational.
        - If the line is busy or experiencing connectivity issues.

#### Step 4: Check Fax Logs

1. Access the fax logs on the machine or through its software interface to review:
    - Details of sent and received faxes.
    - Any reported errors (e.g., transmission failures, busy signals, or line errors).

#### Additional Troubleshooting Steps

1. Restart the Fax Machine/Printer:
    
    - Power off the device, wait a few seconds, and power it back on to reset its functions.
2. Check for Line Noise or Interference:
    
    - Plug a standard phone into the fax line and listen for static, noise, or a clear dial tone.
3. Verify Phone Line Status:
    
    - Contact the phone service provider to ensure there are no outages or issues with the fax line.
4. Inspect Cables and Ports for Damage:
    
    - Look for frayed or damaged cables and replace them if necessary.
    - Ensure the ports are free of dust or debris.

#### Conclusion

- If these steps don’t resolve the issue, escalate the problem to IT or the phone service provider for further investigation.
- Document all steps taken and any observations (e.g., busy signal, failed logs) to assist with further troubleshooting.
