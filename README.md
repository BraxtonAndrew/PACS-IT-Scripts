## Additional Notes

### PowerShell Requirements

1. PowerShell is built into Windows. It is recommended to run PowerShell through VSCode as an administrator, as most scripts require admin privileges.
2. Some scripts may prompt you to sign into your Cloud Admin account, displaying a pop-up window for authentication

### Python Requirements

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system to run Python scripts.
2. Some Python scripts require your Freshservice API Key and Group ID (Listed Below):
    - **To retrieve your Freshservice API Key:**
        
        1. Open Freshservice and click your profile icon in the top-right corner.
        2. Select "Profile Settings."
        3. Complete the CAPTCHA on the far-right side of the profile settings page.
        4. Your API Key will be displayed after verification.
        
        **Note:** Do not share your API Key with anyone.
3. All of the python scripts run as .pyw files meaning they are executable and don't need to run from an IDE (VSCode) and can be run simply by double clicking on them after updating the required information and saving
