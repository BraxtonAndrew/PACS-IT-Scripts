# Welcome to the PACS IT Scripts Repository!

## Disclaimer

**Please review this README and carefully read each script before execution.** While I’ve included detailed instructions to ensure a smooth experience, a basic understanding of coding is recommended for optimal use. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for assistance.

These scripts are provided **"as-is"** and may require modifications to suit specific use cases. Please test scripts thoroughly before deploying them in production environments. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable—thank you for supporting this collaborative effort!

## Additional Notes

### PowerShell Requirements

1. **Built-in PowerShell**: PowerShell comes pre-installed on Windows. For the best experience, run PowerShell scripts via **VSCode** with administrator privileges, as most scripts require elevated permissions.
2. **Cloud Admin Authentication**: Certain scripts may prompt you to sign in to your Cloud Admin account. A pop-up window will appear for authentication.

### Python Requirements

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system to execute Python scripts.
2. **Freshservice API Key & Group ID**: Some scripts require your Freshservice API Key and Group ID. Follow these steps to retrieve them:
    - **Retrieve Freshservice API Key**:
        
        1. Log in to Freshservice and click your profile icon (top-right corner).
        2. Navigate to **Profile Settings**.
        3. Complete the CAPTCHA on the right-hand side.
        4. Copy your API Key once it appears.
        
        > **Important:** Do not share your API Key with anyone.
        
3. **Python Script Execution**: All Python scripts in this repository are configured as `.pyw` files. These can be executed directly by double-clicking them (no need to open an IDE like VSCode). Ensure all required information is updated and saved before running.
